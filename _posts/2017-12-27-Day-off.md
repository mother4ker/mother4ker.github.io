I’m taking the day off. I had grand illusions of coding but was off to a slow start. Until I downloaded the app working copy... I can code on my iPad now- sweet. 

I need to figure out how markdown works because I’m feeling pretty rusty and like I could stand to learn a few tricks. 

A day later and I still feel like Jekyll is awesome.

One thing I want to know is where to store pages other than blog posts if I still want them to be a part of my Jekyll site. 

Let’s find the answer...

It looks like people are just throwing them in with everything else! I’m just going to try it and see if it works 

This is a pretty under-looked-at topic, so it seems. Or it just comes naturally to everyone except me. Tania put together [a nice post](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) ... it’s a full tutorial on making a static site with Jekyll, so perhaps a little more than I need, but I like the content and the explanation is great for someone new to Jekyll, like me. 


Another thing... watched a [video](https://youtu.be/Zftx68K-1D4) and you should too. Web development 2018- a practical guide . 

It got me thinking ... I develop things. So then... I am a developer. What is the problem, then? 

There are people out there who will pay me to do what I already know how to do, so I shouldn’t feel bad about not knowing everything right now (though that’s not going to stop my anxiety from making me feel bad that I don't know everything right now). 


Nice write up about Jekyll and [why it’s just sooo good](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/hugo-vs-jekyll). Funny cause it talks about needing the command line. I wonder if I should do a blog post about to build a Jekyll blog without the command line. Hell, I can show people how to do it using only their phone [I later did this in a tutorial on YouTube but had to take it down].

Who is Emily Dickinson? 

She’s a badass. But I need a fancy English degree to make it through her [bio](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/emily-dickinson)
