### Shit that bothers me:
1. I wish I didn't know [how much butter goes into Jenny Cookies](http://jennycookies.com/2017/07/best-sugar-cookies-ever-the-jenny-cookies-recipe/)
2. Going back to court next week. FML. 
3. Need to [get dress for friends wedding](https://www.azazie.com/all/bridesmaid-dresses/colors/dusty-rose/with/length/floor-length). (does not actually bother me, but it is on my to do list so this is me, reminding me: **DO IT**!
4. Make pile of mail your bitch. 
5. Read more books.
6. Stop being a piece of shit. 

### Thankful as Hell:
1. I'm thankful AF for Ikea. I'm feeling extra productive in my new office. 
2. I'm thankful for my little sister, who is a badass and a way better mom than me. Same goes for my older sister, actually. 
3. I love Spotify, especially this playlist "Pop Chillout"

I put that shit on and just groove. In my new office. From Ikea. 
This is my job now.
