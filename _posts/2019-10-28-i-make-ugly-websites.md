Hi my name is Kelsey and I'm a web developer specializing in ugly fucking websites. 

My segment on the Doctors airs tomorrow so I need to have things looking good. I've been making updates like adding a custom nav bar, but of course it doesn't actually show up on the web page once I upload my files. 

The whole world is going to know how shitty I am. 

**Update:**

I fixed it. I uploaded the wrong file to Cpanel so my changes weren't even there. Oops. [Still ugly](safeDM.com), but at least it's functional.
