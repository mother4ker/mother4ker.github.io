I haven't been blogging. I've been in my head too much.

I've been busy... taking naps mostly. staring at my plants. I'm also launching a startup (you can do that laying down).

Im part of a team working on a filter for Twitter called safeDM. I wanted to call it the pecker wrecker but Manuel said no. 

The filter uses Artificial Intelligence, or AI, to identify dick pics and delete them from your DMs. Pretty cool right? 

I've been testing it out by having people send in copious amounts of dick pics. It's been... interesting. 

After a five month break (my fault) I'm back going to the shrink. I've been trying to get my meds right for over a year, shit's exhausting. Actually taking them is half the battle. I'm always taking yesterday's meds. 

Something cool coming up- I'm going to be on The Doctors later this month. They interviewed me about the dick pic project. I'm also working on an article for HuffPost Uk about the project. I'm really excited about it!! 

I applied to Ada academy again. Hopefully I have better luck this time around. It would be nice to get the full classroom experience.
