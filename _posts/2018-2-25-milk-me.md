I hate Sundays because I know Monday is about to happen.

Weekend was cool. I ate tacos every day. Baby got his first hair cut. He hated it, but at least now I won't have to deal with people asking me when he is getting his hair cut.  

### My husband admitted to being a Feminst today, so that's a thing now.  

Spent a good chunk of the weekend fighting internet crime and ignoring my actual duties. So much revenge porn, shit's getting out of hand. Rhonda thinks I'm obsessing and that I need to stop. She's not wrong. But I also can't stop. Too mad. 

You know what, Rhonda? Maybe *you* need therapy! I hate your ideas and I don't want to listen to you. 

Maybe therapy wasn't made for people like me. I always think I know better than the therapist. I smile and nod at the suggestions but I know I'm not going to listen to her. I like to think that if I stopped paying her to listen to my problems she'd miss me, so I just keep doing it. I'm a giver, what can I say. 

In other news...
### Someone made me into a meme!

Do you like it? 

I feel like read somewhere that it's not healthy to seek revenge on others but I don't really care. at all.

The army has been helping me deal with all of this. So grateful for them and all the support they have offered me. 

#### Now I get a chance to give back! 

The founder said that I can make the website for the group. Someone was working on it, but it's not working out for whatever reason, so now I get to! I'm excited about the project because it's something I'm passionate about and the group already has a ton of great content that I can use to craft a really sweet website. They have a very active social media presence, and they have a domain name, they just need someone to make the damn thing. 

I'm your girl! Try to stop me Rhonda, I swear to God. 

Kevin Wang would be proud. 

I began the process of getting my nudes removed from the gross website today. I can do that now, since the detective has my pics saved as evidence. (Getting those pics to him was awkward AF I might add)

Removing your images can be a long ordeal with legal hoops to jump through. In order to get sites to take the images down, you need to get each of your nudes copyrighted so that you can go after the website for stealing your "intellectual property." 

Can't make this stuff up! 

## Shit That's Bothering Me
1. Laundry
2. Dishes
3. (I'm thinking of a name but I'm not going to say it) 
4. Did I mention that it's Monday tomorrow?
5. Oh my God how could I forget Discord app? I fucking hate discord app. But that's a whole other can of worms. 

## 3 Shits I'm Grateful For
1. My new Tom Petty shirt gets here tomorrow. It better fit. OK I have a confession, me and A both got the shirts. Matching shirts. Coming tomorrow. Now people will finally believe we love each other.
2. Margaritas. 
3. Sass.
