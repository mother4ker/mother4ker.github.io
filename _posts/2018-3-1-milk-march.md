### Things that bother me: 
- Interview tomorrow. Ah. Can we be done yet?
- My lawyer thinks my stalker's lawyer is going to give me a hard time in court in a couple weeks. Go ahead and try me, bitch. 
- I didn't get enough done today. 

### 3 Gratitudes: 
1. Electricity
2. Blankets
3. Potatoes (All forms, but especially mashed)
