title: all my friends are books

For real, though- I might have more friends if I didn't read so much. That sounds terrible.

I created [a separate page](/pages/iRead) to dump all my book updates in case you wanna know what I've been reading. It's ugly but I will give it some love.

I'm getting back to my roots! As a kid one of my favorite things to do was keep track of all the books I had read in a giant excel sheet on my laptop. I tried to get through like a book a day. What I'm trying to tell you is that I didn't have a ton of friends then, either :)
