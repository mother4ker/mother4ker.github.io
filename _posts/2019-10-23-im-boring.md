Sorry I'm boring as fuck. Sorry my trauma does not entertain you enough. 

More people have read my blog in the past six hours than have read it EVER, I'm pretty sure. I shared my revenge porn story and I'm so grateful for all the support I've received. 

Why, then, am I fixating on the one person who said it was boring to read?

I know it's boring. This blog isn't for a wide audience, it's for me. What bothers me is that he felt the need to say anything at all. Who does that? My trauma is not for your fucking entertainment, shithead.
