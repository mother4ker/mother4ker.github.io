So far I am not a fan of 2018. This probably isn't the best outlet to discuss- but it's bad. **REAL BAD.**

Then. 

Imagine my surprise then when I receive a message on Twitter from someone I don't know, saying they found my blog (this one right here). He said he found me inspirational and said to keep going. I thought that was really awesome. 

While the day was still **SHITTY AF**, this guy made it better. So thanks, guy. 

I haven't been super motivated with writing and posting but I am working on some projects- I'm practicing working with images in html with some of my pics from our cruise and outlining some ideas for tutorials in the future. 

ALSO- I did end up registering for developer week- I am beyond excited for that. I registered for the hackathon portion as well... don't really know what to expect for that but hopefully some team is willing to have me even though I consider myself a newbie.
