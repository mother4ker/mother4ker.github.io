I'm overwhelmed thinking about where to start. Adam says just start with now so here it goes.     
  
## My latest endeavor - getting into [Ada Academy](https://apply.adadev.org/). 
I know what you're going to say Mr. Wang- but it's super competitive! 
It's true, they only take 10% of applicants, but I'm going to stay hopeful because I am Ada material & the lady at the unemployment office believes in me! (They make me go OK)

What's New:  

1. **We are partnering with Facebook to end image abuse, NCII, and/or Revenge Porn!**  

I got to tag along with to Facebook Seattle, it was awesome! This is us standing in front of the Facebook wall. Pretty cool huh?

A lot of what discussed was under NDA, but the platform has already made changes in response to discussions we have had with them- and that's pretty freakin' cool.  

2. ## We have a new [index of all revenge porn laws in the US](badassarmy.org/revenge-porn-laws-by-state) available on badassarmy.org now.

*(hint):not all states have them* :( 
##### Never fear, [we are doing something about it!](https://badassarmy.org/2018/04/changemakers/)  
3. ## Met the rest of the team and filmed with (a TOP SECRET TV NETWORK)  
I took a quick trip to Ohio (By quick I mean I was in the state, like, less than 6 hours. It was the first time the leadership team has all been in the same place at the same time, and we're going to be on TV! That's right, I said leadership team! I am now the volunteer CTO & Web Developer for the army.

4. ## This is probably what I'm most excited about if I'm being selfish.  
![filmstrip for my video "my revenge porn nightmare"](/images/revengepornnightmarefilmstrip.jpeg)  
It's not done but it's getting there. Eventually it will be an animated short film about my experience dealing with revenge porn.

5. ## ALL THIS
![more projects](/images/Imadeallthis.jpeg)  
Can you tell I've been doing lots of work for the org? Can't say much about White Knight yet other than it is a Web Application our developers created to notify victims if their photos may have been shared online without their consent.  
The artwork on the right is for an upcoming piece I will be publishing on the Badass blog. 

6. ## I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU HARRY
