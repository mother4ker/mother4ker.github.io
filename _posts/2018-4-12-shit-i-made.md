### Shit I made recently (a list):
1. A [blog post](https://badassarmy.org/2018/04/changemakers/) for [BADASS](https://badassarmy.org) ![This Blog Post](https://badassarmy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/change-is-coming-e1523594846671.jpg) .
2. Barbie-Q banner for my nieces 3rd birthday- how freakin' cute is this? ![barbieQ](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Daohw8qVMAUKHI8.jpg:large)
3. This meme for equal pay day ![equal pay day 2018](https://github.com/kdawgy/kdawgy.github.io/blob/master/_posts/assets/equalPayDay.JPG?raw=true)

Is it still a meme if it's not clever? It's been fun to do a little design work, even though I'd enjoy it more if I could locate my apple pencil.
