I know what it looks like, but yesterday was **not** a zero day, Sean Wang; I just didn’t get a chance to write. I made something for my portfolio, which I haven’t done in a minute. It’s another Jekyll site. Take a look:

I’m trying to talk my husband into letting me go to Developer week since tickets are half off right now. He’s actually fine with it, so it’s more like I need to talk myself into it. HALF OFF!
