![sick beats](/images/sickbeats.png)
It's been a quiet weekend, other than the sick beats coming out of my raspberry pi.
I'm learning coding and music at the same time, what could be better than this? (well maybe it'd be better if I actually knew anything about music)
ANYHOW, Im having fun and that's what it's all about. Too bad I didn't have one of these bad boys growing up, I'd be a supernerd by now!
