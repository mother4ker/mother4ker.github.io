title: Bootstrap's the Best 
---

Who doesn't love a good Bootstrap tutorial to get them in the mood for makin' stuff. It's just so nice and easy. 
![TUTORIAL](https://github.com/kdawgy/kdawgy.github.io/blob/master/_posts/assets/justplayin.jpg?raw=true)
I did [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-your-first-bootstrap-4-0-site-b54bbff6bc55).

Some of this is familiar to me but I haven't done a lot with the navigation bar component OR forms, so this was perfect. I accomplished a lot in very little time. Bootstrap is easy, we know this. And I alreadu jumbotron everything as it is so this was an easy transition. 

Something that *is* new is the cards function. 

### *"A card is a whole new component of Bootstrap 4.0, and itâ€™s replacing panels, wells, and thumbnails from Bootstrap 3.0."*

no biggie here, I wasn't too familiar with those anyway and won't have a problem switching. 

We are just making your basic portfolio website. With minimal, minimal, code. 

### [This is my interpretation](https://kdawgy.github.io/pages/bootstrap4Tutorial/) of the tutorial
