title: My Revenge Porn and Me 
---
What's happening in my revenge porn case? Nothing. That's the problem. It's been two years since *he* posted my naked body online and he's still out there, free. 

I still think about it a lot,  but it's not always at the front of my mind anymore. When I remember what happened, it hits me right in the gut and instantly I feel sick. I dread seeing him in court but I have to make myself go, just so I know he's as miserable as I am. 

This man is a stranger to me now. We dated back in high school when I was only 14-17. We are 28 and 29 now, completely different people. I know nothing about him, but he knows everything about me. It's the grossest feeling. 

He cyber stalked me for ten years, ever since we broke up in high school. I know this because that's how far back the photos go that he stole from me and posted online. He was into everything- social media accounts, emails, my cell phone. This person was watching me. He collected all of my nude photos and then shared them in a thread dedicated to my high school.

People were commenting under the photos with my full name and saying things like "I had no idea she was a slut". They asked for more and he posted more, trading pictures of me for other women. Women might be the wrong word considering some of the girls posted I have confirmed were as young as 15. 

I only knew the photos were there because a stranger reached out to me on Facebook to tell me. By that time, some of the photos had already been up for over two months. Family members had seen them. I wou ld wake up every morning to check the site for more photos, and sometimes I'd be posted again. It was awful. 

It was a month before I knew who was behind it. It was a really scary time because I had no idea who it could be. The photos were from a ten year span and sent to different people, who did not know each other. 

I reported all of this to police. I told them I thought someone had been watching me for a long time. They thought a more likely explanation was that these photos had been shared between guys, even after I told them that was impossible. I showed them evidence of an IP address accessing my accounts that did not belong to me. They told me I was probably wrong even though they knew nothing about how IP addresses work. They asked me questions like "how many more of these could be out there?"

The police didn't do anything to help me. After they made the report, I never heard from them again. When I solved the case myself and had a name and confession, they finally put a detective on it, but as far as the investigation? I was on my own. The truth is they are just not equipped to deal with these cases. 

I was granted a restraining order. That's the only thing protecting me from this let's now. Every month or two we go back to court for a status update and nothing ever happens other than the case gets extended out further. 

He is being charged with a felony. Right now we are set to go to trial in December but its unclear if it will actually happen. Everything in the courts takes so long. It doesn't help that the prosecutor's office lost my case for six months, putting me at the end of the line. 

Nothing about this has been easy. I have had to push every step of the way to be heard and to get people to take this crime seriously. I want to see him held responsible for what he did but I don't have a lot of hope anymore. It's easier this way.
