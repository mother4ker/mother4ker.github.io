title: Fuck My Life: My Revenge Porn and Me

What's happening in my revenge porn case? Nothing. That's the problem. It's been two years since some freak posted my naked body online and he's still out there, free. 

I still think about it a lot,  but it's not always at the front of my mind anymore. When I remember what happened, it hits me right in the gut and instantly I feel sick. I dread seeing him in court but I make myself go, just so I know he's as miserable as I am. 

This man is a stranger to me now. We dated back in high school when I was 14-17. I'm 28 now, we are completely different people. I know nothing about him, but he knows everything about me. It's the grossest feeling. 

He cyber-stalked me for ten years, ever since we broke up in high school. I know this because that's how far back the photos go that he stole from me and ultimately posted online. He was into everything of mine- social media accounts, emails, my cell phone. This person was watching m closely. He collected all of my nude photos and then shared them in a thread dedicated to my high school.

People were commenting under the photos, sharing my full name and saying things like "I had no idea she was a slut". They asked for more and he posted more, trading pictures of me for other women. "Women" might be the wrong word considering some of the girls posted I have confirmed were **as young as 15.**

I only knew the photos were there because a stranger reached out to me on Facebook to tell me. He found me easily. By that time, some of the photos had already been up for over two months. Family members had seen them. I would wake up every morning to check the site for more photos, and sometimes I'd be posted again. It was awful. 

It was a month before I knew who was behind it. It was a really scary time because I had no idea who it could be. The photos were from a ten year span and sent to different people, who did not know each other. I stressed constantly not knowing what was coming next or when. I lost a lot of weight. I didn't tell anyone what had happened because I didn't even know what had happened.

I reported everything to police. I told them I thought someone had been watching me for a long time. They thought a more likely explanation was that these photos had been shared between the guys, even after I told them that was impossible. I showed them evidence of an IP address accessing my accounts that did not belong to me. They told me I was probably wrong even though they clearly knew less than I did about technology.

I called them a couple weeks later because my stalker was promising more nudes would be posted and I wanted to stop him. Nobody at the station knew what I was talking about, they sent me around in a circle, and I eventually gave up on them helping me. I was desperate.

I took matters into my own hands, forcing the creep to reveal himself to me. When I saw his name come up on my caller ID everything clicked and I wanted to throw up. 

Only when I had solved the case did the police actually put a detective on it. As far as the investigation? I was on my own. The truth is law enforcement are just not equipped to deal with these cases. I hate to think about what other victims must have to go through who are less technical.

What have I got from all of this? Well, I was granted a restraining order. That's the only thing protecting me from this guy now. Every month or two we go back to court for a status update and nothing ever happens other than the case gets extended out further. 

He is being charged with a felony, cyber trespass. Right now we are set to go to trial in December but its unclear if it will actually happen. Everything in the courts takes so long. It doesn't help that the prosecutor's office lost my case for six months, putting me at the end of the line. 

I'm nonchalant about all of this now but nothing about this has been easy. I have had to fight every step of the way to be heard and to be taken seriously. I want to see him held responsible for what he did but honestly? I don't have a lot of hope that will happen anymore. I want him to leave me alone forever.
