I sewed today! I'm sewing a child-sized quilt using scraps I had laying around. I'm going to donate it to charity when I'm done. I streamed it on Twitch and had a decent showing. We talked about some security stuff, but mostly I talked to myself. It was great! 

I'm making a concentrated effort to spend more time in my office in hopes that I start getting more done. This week it's a quilt, next week it will be an app to take over the world .
