title: Calendars are a Commitment
---

Yesterday's quote of the day: 
### "My friends tell me I have an intimacy problem. But they don't really know me."
-Gary Shandling. Comedian.

I have no idea what you mean, Gary... :) 

Today's quote of the day is pure shit so I'm not going to bother sharing. 

I have this calendar that I bought during the holidays- it sits on the desk an you tear off a page each day to reveal a "smart saying". 

Some are smart, some are not (or I am too stupid to appreciate them.)

I keep the ones I like in a pile that moves around and has no home. If I hate it, like today's, I rip it up and throw it away. sometimes I just can't handle the inspirational quotes. 

In case I forget to do milk later- court tomorrow, 

### Oh, Joy!

**Commitment**. *noun*. The state or quality of being dedicated to a cause, activity, etc.

I'm going to code some shit today. I'm listening to the Killers. I can do anything to the Killers.
