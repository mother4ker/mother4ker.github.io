title: holla challah!

![Wheat](/images/wheat.png)
Me and A went out to anniversary dinner last night. We ate at Salty's in Seattle- and nobody gives a shit about what I ate (fried chicken and mashed potatoes).

I need to double down on My Ada application and get it done! I think part of me is putting off finishing it because I'm nervous to put myself out there and *not* get it. Again. 

**Bothers Me:**
- **Twinkle Toes.** Every night when I'm trying to fall asleep, I notice that my toes are wiggly and they dont stop. I might be able to stop them for a moment but as soon as I start thinking about something else they go right back to wiggling. I believe that my toe wiggling is burning extra calories at night, and thats how I got this sexy.

**Grateful For** 
- Potatoes
- Cloudy weather. It's not depression if it's September! 
- Local bakery that carries challah loaves so I can pretend to be a good Jewish wife, even though I'm not Jewish or a good wife. They're surprisingly hard to find when it's not the sabbath (That's Jewish for Friday).
