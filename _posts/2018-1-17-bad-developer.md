I need to get better about writing. I'm sorry, Mr. Wang. 

I've got some projects going. I just filmed a tutorial on how to create a website with blog using github pages and Jekyll. I need to work on editing that and putting it all together for my new channel on YouTube. I just filmed it on my phone because I'm impatient and didn't want to wait for Adam to get home to help me do it the 'right' way. 

Another project I'm working on- Im using the photos from our cruise to make a static website for my portfolio. I'm making it using html, css, and bootstrap. It's nothing exciting yet, but it's proven to be challenging just to get the pics up and in order. Everything looked great on mobile but when I'm on a computer some of the pictures are flipping sideways and upside-down. It's so annoying but I haven't figured out what the fix is yet. I think it has to do with some data I cannot see because they seem to be pics I took on my phone, like maybe the phone was rotated when the picture was taken. I don't know. I'm purposefully not linking to it but I do know how to ;)
