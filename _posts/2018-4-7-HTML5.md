### Another tutorial tonight because sometimes I need inspiration. 
![The Tutorial](https://github.com/kdawgy/kdawgy.github.io/blob/master/_posts/assets/html5tut.jpg?raw=true)

Theres an awesome overview of the course [on free code camp here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/want-to-learn-how-to-built-websites-heres-our-free-full-length-html5-course-4ca68cd4a39a). Highly recomend checking out both!

Link to the full-length hour-long course [is here](https://scrimba.com/g/ghtml). 
 
My hackjob will be [here!](https://kdawgy.github.io/pages/HTML5tutorial/index.html) Enjoy. 

Really liked the guys explanation of [linking to stylesheets about two minutes in](https://scrimba.com/p/pZaVfV/c3W7QS8).
