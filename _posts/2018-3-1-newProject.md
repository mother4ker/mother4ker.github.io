I have a new project and I'm stoked about it! I'm "dont wanna do my actual job today"-level stoked about it. I still did my job today I just didn't like it very much... But that could also be because I only have one week left working there before I'm no longer working there. My very last regression. It's the end of an era. These people are jerks and if it didn't hurt my chances of getting my severance I'd tell you right now about how they, quite literally, SHIT on my hopes and dreams. 

The revenge porn org I've been talking with has a need for a website and I'm the girl for the job. I met with the founder yesterday and got all the details as far as what she is wanting to include and the look/feel.

While it sucks this whole nude-sharing fiasco has taken over my life it's nice to have something positive to direct my energy toward. 

I think I will probably make the site on Wordpress so that it's easy for others to update if needed.
