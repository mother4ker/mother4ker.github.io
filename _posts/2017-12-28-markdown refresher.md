title: markdown is fun
---

I **finally** took the time to refresh my markdown skills. 

[Here's an awesome cheat sheet I used](http://commonmark.org/help/)

**and** [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/5/) was very helpful as well. 

As much as I hate to pause and cover the the **very** basics, I know the time spent upfront will pay off. Most likely by the end ot the day. As long as I am honest with myself about what I do not understand, I can go and figure it out. 

I wonder what Sean Wang is doing right now? Safe to say it's not markdown, but I think he'd be proud of me for not having a zero day. 

**What's Coming**
This week I hope to play around with CSS grid and get started doing 30 days of Javascript, which I have already commited to doing publicly, I just haven't actually done anything yet...   

I'm saving this for later because I think I will need it... [how to add a caption to an image in markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll ) on Stackoverflow.

I need to spend at least a couple hours writing tests today. For money. It's always hard to focus when I'm obsessing like I have been the past few days. It probably doesn't help that the pharmacy is out of my meds and works been kinda *meh*. Between my manager skipping my 1:1's and my not hearing any feedback from my GoForCode interview almost *2 months ago*... I'm not feeling too warm and fuzzy about the whole work scenario. I am, however, thankful for the opportunities it has provided and continues to provide me. I &hearts; my job.  

### Speaking from the future... I can say that the whole GoForCode thing did not work out. Supposedly it had nothing to do with the shitty interview where the person interviewing me in a tiny phone room appeared to lack any sort of control of their asshole or the noises it was making. 

I never wanted to have to write those words in a public forum - but it happened... and it changed me. It's one of my top ten formative moments, and not in a good way!
