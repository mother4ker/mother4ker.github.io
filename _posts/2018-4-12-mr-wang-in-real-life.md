I was scrolling on Twitter yesterday. A developer I follow, Stephanie Something, retweeted a guy. His name was [Sean Wang](https://twitter.com/swyx). I clicked on it. Holy Shit. It was *the* Sean Wang. My arch nemesis, Sean Wang. The guy from freecodecamp. You know who I mean. [The man who started it all](https://kdawgy.github.io/go/)- the guy who did what I *tried* to do, but failed miserably at. Becoming a developer in a year. 

I got really nervous and thought about blocking him, but I chalked the whole thing up to good fate and followed him instead. Maybe I'll say hi one day. maybe not.
