---
Our ally, [Joseph Cox](https://twitter.com/josephfcox?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), wrote about the org again in VICE MOTHERBOARD! He even quoted me as well as a couple other badasses.

I never wanted to be a victim of revenge porn, but I'm happy that it's happening now, when the practice is getting so much publicity and people are changing the way they talk about this. Revenge porn is a crime and it's time we start holding these creeps accountable.
