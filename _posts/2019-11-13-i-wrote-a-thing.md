My name is Kelsey and I am a published author.
It's just the Internet but it's still pretty cool. Before this I have only ever been published on blogs that I was helping to run myself, or under names that were not mine. I was commissioned by the Huff Post UK to write a piece about my experience with @showYoDiq and I am so happy with how it turned out.  I'm proud of this one! I couldn't have done it on my own, though. I give all the props to Jasmine who helped me get my messaging straight and did a ton of edits to make the piece as awesome as it is! Without further ado, [here you go](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/cyberflashing-revenge-porn_uk_5dce6dcce4b0d2e79f8a785f?ncid=other_homepage_tiwdkz83gze&utm_campaign=mw_entry_recirc)!
