What's bothering me 
- phone hasn't worked in over a week. At first it was nice but now I'm just annoyed.
- I'm a POS
- Restitution paperwork came. While overall it's a good thing, that's where I have to itemize how much money the dumb shit who posted my nudes online has cost me. I just hate thinking about it. And whatever number I come up with, it will never be enough. 

What's good
- finally finished something I've been writing for over a month - my first commissioned piece ever!
- Prosecutor is going to offer a plea deal to mr fuckface so here's hoping he will agree to our terms and just plead guilty already. I don't want to go to trial 
- I'm not hosting a thanksgiving this year
