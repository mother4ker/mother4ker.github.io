It's almost time to go back to court again. 

My expectations are low. The defense hasn't contacted me or the other witness so I think they will most likely ask for yet another continuance. If this is going to trial they're going to want to talk to us first. And they haven't. Best case scenario is that he will plead guilty so we can avoid trial altogether...  but I know that's asking a lot. 

This time of year is hard for me because it reminds me of when it happened. I can't believe it's been two years already. I know I'm closer to justice than I was back then but it doesn't always feel that way. I feel like time froze that day, and I've just been stuck in limbo, waiting. 

I'll know more in a couple weeks.
