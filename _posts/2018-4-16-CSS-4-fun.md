title: CSS 4 Fun w/ Diamonds
---
Im Playing around with CSS Today. Look at this pretty background! 
![Pretty things with CSS](https://github.com/kdawgy/kdawgy.github.io/blob/master/_posts/assets/luxdesigns.jpeg?raw=true)
Creative market has some awesome [free downloads this week](https://creativemarket.com/free-goods). My favorite is probably the [diamonds are forever pack](https://creativemarket.com/hellokisdottir/1629401-Diamonds-are-Forever)... They have vectors and patterns which is what I used here. Then I used the repeat property in CSS to make it repeat accross the whole screen. 
Really liking [this](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sacramento?selection.family=Sacramento) Google font too. It's called 'Sacramento' - so pretty!
Lux is my cat and she does not actually have her own design business, although she definitely has the hustle & the eye for it.  
[This is the page](https://kdawgy.github.io/pages/diamond/) I was playing around with if I ever want to go look at it again.
