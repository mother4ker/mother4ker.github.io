He pleaded guilty. I should feel like celebrating, and I will, but I feel a lot of other things, too. I'm nervous for what this means. I'm anxious for the sentencing, where he may get up to a year in jail. I'm supposed to write a victim impact statement to read at the sentencing and I don't know where to start. Sometimes I want to ask for the maximum sentence and other times I want to be more forgiving than that.
