I'm not doing anything with myself these days because I'm a lazy piece of shit. My psychiatrist says my brain is just sick and to be kind to myself but I don't feel like it. She doesn't know! 

I just like to stay home with my plants. Sometimes I go to the store to buy more plants. Or food. 

Have a good night.
