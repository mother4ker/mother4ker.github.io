title: BADASS brews

[BADASS](https://badassarmy.org/) is having a fundraiser that involves drinking so I got tasked with some design work that involves drinking. My pleasure :) 
### Isn't it fun?!

If you've seen the header of our website then this will be familiar to you. If I lived anywhere near there perhaps I go. 

I'm working on a couple other projects for them. Stay tuned. 

And if you can, [Please Donate](https://badassarmy.org/donate/)! 

Cheers!
