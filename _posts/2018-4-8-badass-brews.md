The org is having a fundraiser that involves drinking so I got tasked with some design work that involves drinking. My pleasure :) 
### Isn't it fun?!

If you've seen the header of our website then this will be familiar to you. If I lived anywhere near there perhaps I'd go. 

I also designed a custom Snapchat filter that will only be accessible at the event!

I'm working on a couple other projects for them. Stay tuned.
