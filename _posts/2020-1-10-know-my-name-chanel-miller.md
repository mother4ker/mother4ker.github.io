I've been waiting for this book. I needed it. 

Chanel puts into words what I have not been able to. I know my situation pales in comparison to hers. Rape is far more serious than revenge porn. Still, though, there is so much i can relate to. 

Both of us have had things taken from us by people who felt entitled to our bodies- abused by men who had no regard for our futures. 

She talks about her experience with the courts. The invasiveness. The pain. The waiting and lack of control. The feeling of utter helplessness. The total lack of privacy. I see you Chanel. And I'm sorry. 

This book was perfect to get me ready for my own trial, which has been postponed again, this time until March.
