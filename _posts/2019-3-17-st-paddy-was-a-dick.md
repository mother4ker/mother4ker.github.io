Has it really been this long since I wrote something here? 

##Facts:
* All my friends are still books.
* I still like computers.
* I didn't get into ADA academy. 
* I'm still crazy. 
* I mean well 
* I try hard -when I feel like it

2019 May give 2018 a run for its money and that's really saying something. 

I saw my stalker for the first time in years. We had court- he's in some trouble :) He looked the same as when I knew him. But I don't fucking know him. He is a stranger and we are in court over him spying on me and being gross and this whole thing is really weird . 

I'm thankful for some justice, finally, but wouldn't it be cool if this didn't happen?

I don't do the milk thing anymore, too much pressure. Everything is pressure.
