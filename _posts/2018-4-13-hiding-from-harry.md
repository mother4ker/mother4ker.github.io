title: Hiding from Harry

I've been avoiding Harry because I haven't been mindful enough. I told him I watched the Anderson Cooper video and let him know I thought it was weird but I will still try it evetually. He said some of the sessions he sent me are just 3-5 minutes. 3-5 minutes can be hard to come by when it's something I don't feel like doing. 

He said if it feels like one more thing to to, then don't do it. And that's what it's feeling like.
