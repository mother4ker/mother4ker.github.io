Last night I went to my ten year reunion. Why didn't anyone tell me no?? 

Kidding- plenty of folks told me no. It's true that ten years isn't quite long enough. I think I'll skip the 20. 

Today I played a little hacker "capture the flag". I'm not very good at it. I've also been coding a bit which feels nice :).
