**What's good**
- I've been commissioned by the huffington post to write a piece about the filter. Cool :) 
- A found my missing AirPod. I was getting ready to replace it! Turns out Jack left it in the cupboard when he was looking for a snack


**What's bad**
- writer's block or lack of motivation??
- MacBook screen is busted and I can only see half of it
- it's hard to know what to do when you've never done it before
