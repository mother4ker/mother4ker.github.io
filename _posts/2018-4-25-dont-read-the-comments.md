But I did read them. I can handle it. 
Lets take a look. 8 comments. What could go wrong. 
- 1 comment calling the other woman pictured in the article a dog.
- 1 comment revealing the name of a revenge porn site if people want to go look (article left that out purposefully)
- 6 comments saying that's what we get for taking the photos in the first place.

I lost hope in humanity a long time ago (at least when it comes to this topic) so I didn't care enough to feed the trolls today.
