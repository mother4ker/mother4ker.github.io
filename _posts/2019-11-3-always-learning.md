I've been keeping a Jekyll blog for two years now and I'm still learning new things all the time. I have never taken the time to look into categories or tags. I'm adding categories to some of my old posts now to make things easier to organize and navigate . 

I made a categories page that lists all my blog posts by title under their respective category. The new page is  [here](https://mother4ker.github.io/categories/) . I made another page [here](https://mother4ker.github.io/tech/) that is for all of my posts related to technology 

I did this by following [this person's tutorial ](https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/)
