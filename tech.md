- Raspberry Pi . Cheapest little computer there ever was. Use it for learning to code, hacking, or any number of DIY projects. The [Pi 4 basic 2 gig kit](https://amzn.to/3294eJP) comes with almost everything you will need.(you'll need [another cord](https://amzn.to/2WE38oo) if you want a heads-up display)  I got two of them and put them in little pink cases that were 3D printed by my sister on the ender printer.  She prints all her own cookie cutters and is fabulous! she used the [ender 3](https://amzn.to/32fq6mZ) but I've been eyeing the newer [ender 5](https://amzn.to/32bGJzQ) for awhile! Looks pretty slick. 

- Yubikey by Yubico. Love these because they let me [use 2fa on things like gmail](https://amzn.to/2Nb7qQJ) without me having to find my phone (never know where it is) .
