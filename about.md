I'm Kelsey! I'm a wannabe web developer and entrepreneur with a habit of causing a ruckus. I stand up against things like revenge porn and online harassment of all kinds.

### More Information

If you'd like to [support my trip to DEFCON](https://www.gofundme.com/f/tits4defcon) next year I'd appreciate it so much! All funds will go to DEFCON expenses, with anything above my needs funding scholarships for other Women and Allies in Tech.
