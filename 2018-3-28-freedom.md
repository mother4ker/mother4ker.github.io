I am *FREE*! And by free I mean I am no longer working for a Fortune 100 company doing QA. I'm still working a lot, just in spurts and only when I feel like it. 

The job I was interviewing for... I didn't get it. With all the other stuff going on, I really can't dwell on it. I need this time off, truly I do, and I was only going for that position with everything else on my plate because I would have been working with my favorite manager of all time. He still remains my favorite. 

### I WAS GOING TO PEE IN A CUP FOR YOU! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS?!

I am spending a lot of time on the org and helping other victims of revenge porn. I have been able to help so many other women in my area deal with this, and that is rewarding. Even though I wish more women would press charges... It is such a huge relief for them even to get their pictures taken down. 

I am happy to have this time away from work. Even though I was working from home, it was still a lot to stay on top of. I have been considering going all in and starting my business or using the time to work on my coding skills and build out my portfolio. Perhaps I could be doing both. I am overwhelmed with possibilities, but I am certain that this time away from work will not be wasted!
